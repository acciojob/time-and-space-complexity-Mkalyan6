	<h1>Information of Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity measures the amount of computational time an algorithm requires in relation to the input size. It quantifies how the execution time grows as the input size increases. Big O notation is commonly used to express time complexity in terms of the worst-case scenario. On the other hand, space complexity evaluates the amount of memory space an algorithm needs relative to the input size. It assesses the growth of memory usage as the input size increases. Like time complexity, space complexity is often expressed using Big O notation, allowing for a standardized way to discuss the scalability and efficient of algorithms in terms of time and space utilization. Efficient algorithms strike a balance between minimizing time and space complexity to ensure optimal performance across various scenarios.

<p><b>Space Complexity</b> is a critical aspect of algorithm analysis, focusing on the amount of memory an algorithm uses in relation to its input size. It measures the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of the additional space required for computation beyond the input data. Space Complexity is particularly crucial in situations where memory resources are limited or need to be optimized. Like time complexity, space complexity is often expressed using Big O(n), providing an upper bound on the growth rate of memory usage. Efficient algorithms aim to minimize space complexity, and various data structures and optimization techniques are employed to achieve this goal. Understanding space complexity is essential for developing algorithms that not only produce correct results but also manage memory resources effectively, ensuring scalability and adaptability across different computing environments. As with time complexity, striking a balance between time and space complexity is crucial for designing algorithms that perform well in real-world applications.
